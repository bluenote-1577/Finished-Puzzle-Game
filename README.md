Hello!

![id](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/Finished-Puzzle-Game/blob/master/PuzzleGame.png)

This is a brief puzzle game I've made using C++ and the SFML libraries.

Instructions : Swap blocks around by dragging them to adjacent blocks. Once 
3 or more blocks of the same colour line up, erase them by clicking the block
and holding either R for clearing rows or C for clearing columns.

For every deletion without swapping colours, the combo counter goes up.
Score more points by pre-arranging all the blocks and then erasing them all
in one big combo!

Erase quickly, or else the blocks will rise to the top and you'll lose!

The debug folder has a compiled exe program ready to go. Simply download and run that program.
